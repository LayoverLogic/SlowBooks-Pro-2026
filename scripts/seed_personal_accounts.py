"""Seed the 19 personal accounts for the net-worth dashboard.

Idempotent — safe to re-run. Skips any account, person, or ownership
row that already exists. For the mortgage account, also inserts the
corresponding `loans` row with placeholder amortization parameters
that the user will edit through the UI before clicking "Generate
schedule" — phase-1 spec is to leave loan_amortization_schedule
empty initially.

Phase 1.5 (alembic j2a3b4c5d6e7) additions:
- Seeds the 3 people (Alex / Alexa / Theodore) so tests that build
  the schema via Base.metadata.create_all (and therefore skip the
  migration's INSERT) still get the household roster.
- Seeds account_ownerships rows for every personal account, mirroring
  the legacy alex_pct / alexa_pct / kids_pct dual-write columns.
- Adds a 19th account: PennyMac Escrow (USD bank, balance_only,
  Alex/Alexa 50/50). Initial balance snapshot is intentionally
  omitted — the user enters that from the next PennyMac statement.

Initial balance snapshots are created for the property and loan
accounts (US House: 299000 USD, US Mortgage: 232000 USD) dated today
so the dashboard has something to render. Other balance_only accounts
(brokerage, retirement, escrow) get no initial snapshot — the user
enters those through the UI.

Mirrors scripts/seed_database.py style: import path setup, SessionLocal,
print summary on completion.
