"""Seed the credit_scores table — phase 1.5 task 3.

Skeleton only. The household enters their own scores through the UI
once the page lands; we don't ship synthetic data because credit
scores are sensitive enough that a fake reading sitting in the table
during dev would be confusing.

Idempotent shape mirrors seed_airline_miles.py so it can grow real
seed data later without restructuring the file.

Usage:
    from seed_credit_scores import apply_seed
    apply_seed(db_session)
    db_session.commit()
