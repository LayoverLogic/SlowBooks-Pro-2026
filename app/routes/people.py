"""People — phase 1.5.

Read-only endpoint for the household members. Used by the ownership
editor's person dropdown and (in later phase-1.5 commits) by the
miles / credit-score pages and the dashboard hoist.

People rows are seeded by the j2a3b4c5d6e7 migration plus the seed
script. The API doesn't expose create/update/delete — the household
roster changes rarely enough that a manual psql edit is the right
escape hatch. If that changes, add the routes here.
