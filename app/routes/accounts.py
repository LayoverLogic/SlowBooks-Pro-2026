# Phase 1.5 dual-write helpers.

# During the dual-write window (lasting ~1 week between migration
# j2a3b4c5d6e7 and the legacy-column drop), every ownership change
# touches both the new account_ownerships rows and the legacy
# alex_pct/alexa_pct/kids_pct columns. Reads come from the join only.
#
# The legacy columns map to fixed person_ids:
#     alex_pct  -> person_id 1 (Alex)
#     alexa_pct -> person_id 2 (Alexa)
#     kids_pct  -> person_id 3 (Theodore)
#
# Ownership rows referencing person_ids outside {1, 2, 3} (e.g. a
# future second child) are still written to the join table but do not
# round-trip into the legacy columns — those columns can't represent
# them. That's intentional: the legacy columns are deprecated and on
# their way out, so no work goes into making them more flexible.
