"""People + account ownerships — phase 1.5.

Replaces the alex_pct / alexa_pct / kids_pct three-column ownership
model on `accounts` with a proper join table. Each personal account
gets one or more rows in `account_ownerships` keyed by (account_id,
person_id), with share_pct that sums to 100 across the rows for any
given account_id. System COA accounts (Service Income etc.) get zero
rows — they're not personally owned.

Sum-to-100 enforcement is layered:
  - DB trigger `trg_account_ownerships_sum` (Postgres only, deferrable)
    catches raw-SQL inserts that bypass the API.
  - Pydantic validation in app/schemas/accounts.py catches API input
    before it hits the DB. Tests use SQLite which has no trigger, so
    app-level validation is doing the work there.

Theodore = kids_pct mapping is one-way and historical — see the
docstring in alembic/versions/j2a3b4c5d6e7_people_and_ownerships.py.
