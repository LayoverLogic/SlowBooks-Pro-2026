"""Pydantic schemas for the people / account_ownerships domain.

Two flavors of OwnershipShare exist:
  - OwnershipShareIn: minimal shape accepted from the client when
    POSTing or PUTting an account (just person_id + share_pct).
  - OwnershipShareOut: returned to the client; same fields as -In.
    The UI looks up person names separately via GET /api/people, so we
    don't denormalize names onto each ownership row.
