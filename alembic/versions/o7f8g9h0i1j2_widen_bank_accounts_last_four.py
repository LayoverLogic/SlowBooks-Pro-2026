"""widen bank_accounts.last_four to varchar(20)

bank_accounts.last_four was sized varchar(4) on the assumption it would
only ever hold the printed last-4 digits of a card. Credit unions like
HCU number their sub-accounts as <member>-<share>, e.g. 75850-0002 for
the joint checking share. Storing those identifiers verbatim is the
clearest way to distinguish the joint checking, joint savings, and
each family member's individual share from the others, so widen to
varchar(20) — enough for any reasonable member-share format with
some headroom.
