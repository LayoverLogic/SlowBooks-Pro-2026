"""bank_transactions.currency — per-row currency for multi-ccy accounts

Revision ID: p8g9h0i1j2k3
Revises: o7f8g9h0i1j2
Create Date: 2026-05-10 00:00:00.000000

Adds a nullable varchar(3) currency column to bank_transactions so a
single bank_account can hold transactions in multiple currencies. This
is needed for Revolut-style multi-currency accounts where the same
ledger contains EUR purchases, CZK vault transfers, GBP card payments,
etc.

NULL means "use the parent bank_account's native currency" — preserves
backward-compat for the ~540 existing single-currency rows (Citi, HCU,
etc.) which all sum cleanly in USD.

For dedup purposes the currency joins (date, amount, normalised
description) in the fingerprint so a CZK 50.00 charge on the same day
as a EUR 50.00 charge no longer collapses to one row.
