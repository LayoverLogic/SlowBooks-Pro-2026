"""Tests for scripts/seed_personal_accounts.py.

Pins:
- Idempotency: re-running the seed creates zero new rows the second time.
- The exact 19-account roster (18 phase-1 + PennyMac Escrow added in
  phase 1.5) with correct ownership splits, currencies, kinds, and
  update strategies.
- Initial balance snapshots only exist for property + loan.
- Mortgage loan row is created with the documented placeholder values
  but the amortization schedule stays empty (spec: regenerate via UI
  after the user enters real values).
- Phase 1.5: people directory + account_ownerships join rows are
  populated alongside the legacy alex/alexa/kids columns.
